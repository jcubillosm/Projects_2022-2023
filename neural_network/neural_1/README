## Neural network

This code is a personal project to train a neural network. 
It consist of a simple code with a HTML and Javascript that shows the user a text in a box and a color picker. The user can change the background color of that box but it is the program who selects the font color between black and white.

At the moment, the neural network has been trained with three cases:
The border case: 
	{input:{red:0, green:0, blue:0}, output:{picker:1}},
	{input:{red:1, green:1, blue:1}, output:{picker:0}}

And with third random case to try to understand how new training cases can be change the results.

It was used a color picker from jcolor.com
The brain.js is the neural network used. This code was obtain from https://unpkg.com/brain.js

This program is based on the youtube video "Tu primera red neuronal - Inteligencia Artificial" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNFFLJPW7KQ&t=421s and it has a personal learning purpose.
